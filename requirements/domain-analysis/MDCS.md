# Moral Distress Consult Service Design & Evaluation

Notes from HEC 2017, MDCS

## Forms of Intervention

### Indirect

* educational  program  to  improve  neonatal  intensive  care (NICU) nurses’ comfort caring for dying patients (Rogers 2008)
* educational program on pediatric quality offlife  using  palliative  care  principles (Brandon et al. 2014)
* Unit-based  ethics  conversations  (UBECs)  were  developed  by  Wocial et  al.  (2010)
* Clinical Ethics Residency program forNurses (CERN) (Grace et al.2014; Robinson et al.2015)

### Direct

* MDCS
* Writing retreat (Brown-Saltzman  and  Hamric2009)
* Moral distress mapping (Dudzinski 2016)
* American  Association  of  Critical  Care Nurses  (AACN)  ‘‘4  As’’approach  (American Association  of  Critical-Care  Nurses2004 (assessment))

### General

* promoting physician-nurse collegial relationships through interprofessional forums, facilitating  changes  in  the  workenvironment,   educating   nurse   leaders   about   moral   distress,   and   encouraging advocacy  on  behalf  of  patients  (McAndrew  et  al.2011;  Karanikola  et  al.2014; Wiegand  and  Funk2012). In  large  part,  general  strategies  have  not  been  tested empirically for effects on clinicians’ moral distress.

## Measures

* perceived frequency of patients receiving care that was not in their best interest
* Pre- and post-intervention reported levels of moral distress, see Moral Distress Scale-Revised (Hamric et al.2012)
* Volume of MD consultations, variety of units in which these occur
* Interviews with stakeholders


## Other functionality

* assist the caller in deciding whether to trigger an ethics consult, a moral distress consult, both, or neither
* Forwarding of recommendation from ethics consultant to MDC
* it may be recommended that the staff member not be assigned to the patient when the conflict of conscience is interfering with the staff member’s ability to provide care
* At the end of the consult, MDCS facilitator summarizes the situation, the right actions, the barriers, and the strategies and seeks confirmation of accuracy from the group (might app or technology system play a role at this level?)
* A confidential summary is provided to the requestor and follow-up is often provided for support and guidance.
* The  summary  often  includes  resources  such  as  hospital  policies  and procedures, journal articles, and national guidelines that the staff may find helpful in crafting or refining their strategies or in framing their discussions with colleagues.
* Documentation is not placed in individual patient charts as with a nEC.  Rather,  a  detailed  summary  is  shared  with  those  who  can  bring  about  the necessary  changes. (HEC Forum (2017) 29:127–143.)

## Non-Functional Properties

* Organizations  must  carefully  consider  the  confidentiality  of these summaries and the most appropriate mechanism for sharing them.
  
## Roles

* unit manager
* advanced practice nurse (APN)
* clinical ethics consultant sometimes generate requests for moral distress consultant
* CNS
* medical director
* attending physician

## Causes of MD

* Inadequate pain management
* Angry physicians
* "moral  distress  is  almost  always  a  symptom  of underlying  unit,  team,  or  system  problems,  and interventions  must  be  directed  to root causes to successfully deal with this phenomenon (HEC Forum 2017)"
* The MDCS differs from the  ECS  in  that  the  primary  goal  of  the  MDCS  is  not  to  provide  assistance  in resolving  patient-focused  ethical  dilemmas  but  to  assist  staff  in  identifying  and addressing  problems  at  the  unit  and  system  levels  such  as  poor  team  communication,  inefficient  unit  routines,  and  ineffective  institutional  protocols  that  arise repeatedly  and  affect  patient  care  negatively. (HEC Forum 2017)
* HEC Forum table 1, decreasing order of occurrence:
  * Inadequate team communication, 41%
  * Unclear treatment plan/lack of goals of care, 25%
  * Inadequate pain management 21%
  * Lack of provider continuity compromising patient care,21%
  * Futile or aggressive treatment not in the patient’s best interest, 19%
  * Abusive/inappropriate patient threatening staff, 19%
  * Family wishing aggressive treatment not in the best interest of the patient, 16%
  * Team giving inconsistent messages to patient/family, 14%
  * Abusive/difficult family compromising quality of care, 13%
  * Incompetent care providers, 11%
  * Inadequate staffing
